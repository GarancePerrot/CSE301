-- Plugging a one-hole context with a binary tree to produce a binary
-- tree is accomplished by the following function
plug :: BinCxt -> Bin -> Bin
plug Hole      t = t
plug (B0 b c (B _ _ t2)) t = B b (plug c t) t2
plug (B1 (B _ t1 _) b c) t = B b t1 (plug c t)

-- Under this definition of plugging, values of type BinCxt are
-- interpreted "inside-out" as describing paths *from* the hole *to*
-- the root.  Alternatively, we can interpret contexts "outside-in" as
-- describing paths from the root to the hole, in which case we would
-- use the following plugging function.


-- But the inside-out representation is more useful for navigating
-- within a tree using "zippers".

-- A zipper is a pair of a one-hole context c and a tree t, which we
-- think of as defining a pointer to t as a subtree of u = plug c t.
type BinZip = (BinCxt,Bin)
-- (The terminology comes from GÃ©rard Huet's paper, "The Zipper".)

-- The following functions implement moving the pointer up to the
-- left child, up to the right child, or down to the parent of a
-- subtree.  (Note that these operations are only partial, i.e., return a
-- Maybe type, since the subtree may not have a child or a parent.)

go_left :: BinZip -> Maybe BinZip
go_left (c,B b t1 t2) = Just (B0 b c t2,t1)  -- focus on the left child
go_left (c,L _)       = Nothing            -- (leaf => no left child)

go_right :: BinZip -> Maybe BinZip
go_right (c,B b t1 t2) = Just (B1 t1 b c,t2) -- focus on the right child
go_right (c,L _)       = Nothing           -- (leaf => no right child)

go_down :: BinZip -> Maybe BinZip
go_down (B0 b c (B _ t2_1 t2_2), t) = Just (c, B b t t2_2)  -- focus on parent *from* left child
go_down (B1 (B _ t1_1 t1_2) b c, t) = Just (c, B b t1_1 t)  -- focus on parent *from* right child
go_down (Hole, _) = Nothing  -- (root => no parent)


-- Finally, we include some pretty-printing routines for binary trees
-- and binary tree zippers.

-- We make use of drawTree :: Tree String -> String from the Data.Tree
-- module, after first defining some conversion routines from Bin's
-- and BinZip's to Tree String's, which also relies on interpreting a
-- BinCxt as a function Tree String -> Tree String.
